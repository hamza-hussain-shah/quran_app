      </div>

          The Holy Quran is the word of Allah Almighty. The construct it has,
          the meaning it carries are unmatchable and not to be found in any
          other book of the world. In addition to the depth of meaning that the
          verses of Quran carry, there is also its sublime language that it
          makes it apart from any of the writings in the world in general and
          Arabic in particular. The Noble Quran is the Divine book towards which
          Muslims turn when they face any problem because the Quran has the
          solution to every problem and it is the guidance for all aspects of
          life.
          <br />
          <br />
          Allah Almighty said about Quran: “This is the Book (the Quran),
          whereof there is no doubt, guidance to those who are Al-Muttaqoon [the
          pious].” (Quran, 2:2)
          <br />
          Quran recitation brings many rewards and blessings from Allah (SWT).
          Muslims will earn great rewards for reciting the Quran and
          implementing it in their daily life routine. In Hadith Prophet
          Muhammad (SAW) stated that: “Whoever recites ten Ayahs (verses) in
          Qiyaam will not be recorded as one of the forgetful. Whoever recites a
          hundred Ayahs (verses) in Qiyaam will be recorded as one of the
          devout, and whoever prays a thousand Ayahs (verses) in Qiyaam will be
          recorded as one of the muqantareen (those who pile up good deeds).”
          (Abu Dawood)
          <br />
          The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) has declared the importance of learning
          the Quran in the hadith: “The one who reads a single letter from the
          Book of Allah will be rewarded with one good deed. (Know that) A good
          deed is multiplied ten times over. I do not say Alif Laam Meem is one
          letter. Verily, Alif is one letter, Laam is one letter, Meem is one
          letter.” (Tirmidhi)
          <br />

        <h1>10 Reasons to Learn Quran</h1>
        <p>
          We should learn the Holy Quran because it is our religious duty and
          also due to many other reasons mentioned below: Source of Guidance:
          The Holy Quran is a source of guidance for all mankind. Reading or
          learning the Quran will help you to find direction in your life and
          Allah Almighty has promised mankind that the effect of reading and
          understanding the Quran is to: “take mankind from the depths of
          darkness to light” (Quran, 14:1) and “guides them to the ways of
          peace” (Quran, 5:16) <br />
          Intercessor on the Day of Judgment: The Holy Quran will intercede on
          the Day of Judgment. Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said that: “Read the
          Quran, for verily it will come on the Day of Standing as an
          intercessor for its companions.” (Muslim) <br />
          To Understand the Purpose of Existence: If someone ever thought about
          the purpose of his/her existence then just open the Holy Quran and
          read from it. The Quran will give insight into how to live with a
          purpose to serve Almighty Allah and many verses of the Noble Quran
          speak about the origins of the existence of human being and this
          Universe. In the Holy Quran, Allah Almighty says: “He created death
          and life to test you as to which of you is best in deed.” (Quran,
          67:2) <br />
          Learn about the Religion Islam: We should learn about our religion
          Islam from the Holy Quran as it is pure, the unchanged message from
          Allah (SWT), nothing has been added, removed, and changed from it
          because Quran is the words of Allah. In the Holy Quran Allah (SWT)
          says: “And the word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in
          justice. None can alter His words, and He is the Hearing, the
          Knowing.” (Quran, 6:115) <br />
          Chance of Communication to the Lord: Quran recitation can be made
          attractive and in doing so it can initiate a sort of conversation with
          Allah Almighty. The example of which can be seen in the form of the
          way Prophet (SAW) read Quran: “And when He (Prophet) recited the
          verses which referred to the Glory of Allah, He glorified Him, the
          Great, and when He recited the verses that mention supplication, He
          supplicated, and when He recited the Verses that mention seeking
          Refuge of the Rabb He sought (His) refuge”(Muslim). <br />
          Quran will lead to Paradise: Learn Quran as it’s recitation will lead
          all of them who recited it regularly to paradise. Our beloved Prophet
          (SAW) stated: “The Quran is an intercessor, something gave permission
          to intercede, and it is rightfully believed in. Whoever puts it in
          front of him, it will lead him to Paradise; whoever puts it behind
          him, it will steer him to the Hellfire.” <br />
          Learn Quran to be from the Best People: If you want to be the ones who
          are best in the eyes of Allah then teach Quran others and learn it
          too. In hadith, our beloved Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said: “The best of
          you are the ones who learn the Quran and teach it to others.”
          (Bukhari) <br />
          Purification of Heart: When a Muslim recites Quran, it affects the
          heart and purifies it by cleaning it from all the impurities that
          stick on it. Allah Almighty says in the Quran: “O mankind! There hath
          come to you an admonition from your Lord and a healing for the
          (diseases) in your hearts and for those who believe a Guidance and
          Mercy.” (Quran, 10:57) <br />
          Find out about the Hereafter: This worldly life does not end at death.
          There is a life after death (hereafter) that will be forever. The Holy
          Quran will teach you about the hereafter and you can read all about
          the amazing privileges and beauty of paradise that Allah (SWT) has
          promised for believers. Learn Quran to increase your Faith (Iman):
          Allah Almighty says in the Holy Quran: “And when a surah is revealed,
          some of them ask “which of you did this increase him in Iman?”. As for
          the ones who believe, it increased them in Iman and they rejoice.”
          (Quran, 9:124) <br />
        </p>
        <h1>Importance of Learning Quran in Islam</h1>
        <p>
          Learning the Quran is a very important act in Islam which brings
          invaluable rewards from Allah (SWT). Actually, It’s one of the best
          things-to-do in order to earn good deeds, get closer to Allah (SWT),
          and enter Jannah (Paradise). As our beloved prophet Muhammad (PBUH)
          says:
          <br />
          Whoever recites a letter from the Book of Allah, he will be credited
          with a good deed, and a good deed gets a ten-fold reward. I do not say
          that Alif-Lam-Mim is one letter, but Alif is a letter, Lam is a letter
          and Mim is a letter.
          <br />
          [Hadith | At- Tirmidhi]
          <br />
          Moreover, there are so many other reasons why every Muslim should
          learn the Quran.
        </p>
        <h1>1. Learning Quran Guides You To The Right Path</h1>
        <p>
          The Holy Quran is the words of Allah Almighty and the source of
          guidance to all mankind. Learning the Quran will help you taking the
          right decisions and following the right path to succeed in this life &
          hereafter. As Allah (SWT) said:
          <br />
          This is the Book (The Quran) about which there is no doubt, a guidance
          for those conscious of Allah.
          <br />

        <h1>2. Quran Recitation Brings Many Rewards, Benefits, and Virtues</h1>
        <p>
          Reciting the Quran brings many rewards and blessings from Allah (SWT).
          Muslims will earn great rewards for reciting the Quran, especially, if
          it’s recited on a daily basis. In this regards, our beloved Prophet
          Muhammad (PBUH) said:
          <br />
          If anyone prays at night reciting regularly ten verses, he will not be
          recorded among the negligent; if anyone prays at night and recites a
          hundred verses, he will be recorded among those who are obedient to
          Allah; and if anyone prays at night reciting one thousand verses, he
          will be recorded among those who receive huge rewards.
          <br />

        <br />
        <h1>3. Learn The Quran To Intercede For You On The Day of Judgment</h1>
        <p>
          What would you want better than that?! When you are in need of an
          intercessor on the Day of Judgment, The Holy Quran will intercede for
          you. As the prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said in the athentic Hadith:
          <br />
          Read the Qur’an, for it will come as an intercessor for its reciters
          on the Day of Resurrection.

        </p>
        <h1>4. Learn Quran To Understand The Purpose of Existence</h1>
        <p>
          If you ever thought about the purpose of creation’s existence, then
          just open the Holy Quran and read. The Quran will give insight into
          how to live with a purpose to serve Allah (SWT). Many verses of the
          Noble Quran speak about the origin existence of human beings and the
          whole universe. As Allah (SWT) says:
          <br />
          And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.
          <br />
          [Holy Quran | 51:56]

        <br />
        <h1>5. The Quran is The Best Source To Learn Isla m</h1>
        <p>
          The Holy Quran is the best way to learn about our religion Islam. It’s
          PURE, nothing has been added, removed, or changed from it; because the
          Quran is the words of Allah (SWT) and no one can alter it. As Allah
          (SWT) said:
          <br />
          Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur’an and indeed, We will be its
          guardian.

        </p>{" "}
        <br />
        <h1>6. Reciting The Quran opens a Dialogue With Allah (SWT)</h1>
        <p>
          Praying and reading the Quran are two ways of opening a dialogue with
          Allah Almighty. Take reciting Al-Fatihah (the opening chapter of the
          Quran) as an example. It is not meant to be a monotonous monologue by
          the believer who recites it, but Allah has made it a warm, loving
          conversation between him and the worshiper. As the prophet Muhammad
          (PBUH) said:
          <br />
          “Allah said: ‘I have divided the prayer between Myself and My slave
          into two halves, and My slave shall have what he has asked for.’When
          the slave says: ‘Al-hamdulillah i rabbil Alameen (All the praise is to
          Allah, the Lord of all that exists),’ Allah says:’My slave has praised
          Me, and My slave shall have what he has asked for.’ And when he says:
          ‘Ar-Rahmanir-Rahim (The Mos Gracious, the Most Merciful),’ Allah says:
          ‘My slave has extolled Me, and My slave shall have what he has asked
          for.’ And when he says: ‘Maliki yawmiddin [The Only Owner and he
          Ruling Judge] if the Day of Recompense,’ Allahs says: ‘My slave has
          Glorified Me. This is for Me, and this Verse is between me and My
          slave in two halves.’ And when he says: ‘ Iyyaka na’budu wa iyyaka
          nastain [You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help],’ He
          says: ‘This is between Me an My slave, and My slave shall have what he
          has asked for.’ And the end of the Surah is for My slave.’ And when he
          says: ‘Ihdinas-siratal-mustaqeema, siratal-alldhina an’amta alayhim a
          lad-dallin [Guide us to the Straight Way, the way of those on whom You
          have bestowed Your Grace, not(the way) of those who earned Your Anger,
          nor of those who went astray],’ He says: ‘THis is for My slave, and My
          slave shall have what he has asked for.”

        <br />
        <h1>7. Learning The Holy Quran Raises Your Status</h1>
        <p>
          If you want to be from the ones who are best in the eyes of Allah,
          learn the Quran, excel in it, then teach it to others. This is from
          the characteristics of the believers who followed the prophet Muhammad
          (PBUH). In this regards, the prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said:
          <br />
          The best among you (Muslims) are those who learn the Qur’an and teach
          it.

        <br />
        <h1>8. Reading The Quran Purifies The Heart & Relief The Soul</h1>
        <p>
          When a Muslim recites the Quran with understanding, it purifies the
          heart from sins and relief the soul from pressures. Allah (SWT) said:
          <br />
          He has succeeded who purifies it (The Soul), And he has failed who
          instills it [with corruption]. [Holy Quran | 91:9-10]

        <br />
        <h1>9. Learn Quran To Learn More About Hereafter</h1>
        <p>
          We, Muslims, believe in the death and eternal life which comes after
          death. We believe in Jannah (Paradise) or Jahannam (Hell). The Holy
          Quran involves so much information about the hereafter life. For
          example, Allah (SWT) in the description of Paradise says:
          <br />
          Is the description of Paradise, which the righteous are promised,
          wherein are rivers of water unaltered, rivers of milk the taste of
          which never changes, rivers of wine delicious to those who drink, and
          rivers of purified honey, in which they will have from all [kinds of]
          fruits and forgiveness from their Lord, like [that of] those who abide
          eternally in the Fire and are given to drink scalding water that will
          sever their intestines

        <p>
          Preoccupation with the Quran is one of the most worthy acts of
          worship; the Reciters of the Holy Quran will be in the company of the
          Noble and Obedient Angels in the hereafter. That’s according to our
          beloved prophet Muhammad (PBUH) when he said:
          <br />
          Indeed the one who recites the Quran beautifully, smoothly, and
          precisely, will be in the company of the noble and obedient angels. As
          for the one who recites with difficulty, stammering or stumbling
          through its verses, then he will have twice that reward.

        <br />
        <h1>Final Advice:</h1>
        <p>
          Holy Quran is the only path towards paradise and salvation. The Noble
          Quran is revealed upon the last Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) for the
          betterment of the entire creation. Revert towards it and apply it in
          every single part of life is your key to succeed in this life &
          hereafter.
          <br />
          What are the benefits of Learning Quran? Learning Quran is a very
          noble act, which every Muslim should be performing daily. It gives
          him/her knowledge about all aspects of life, also brings him/her near
          to the Creator, and will be a proof of the rewards of his/her good
          deeds on the Day of Judgment.
          <br />
          Quran learning is equally required from both Muslim men and women.
          Muslims start learning Quran from the early years of life. The
          continuously connection with Qur’an through its learning brings Muslim
          closer to the Creator, brings great blessing in this worldly life and
          will be a source of big reward in the hereafter.
          <br />
          The benefits of Learning Quran are unlimited with main benefit of
          guidance towards the straight path to Allah.
          <br />
          “Read! In the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists). He
          has created man from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood). Read!
          And your Lord is the Most Generous. Who has taught (the writing) by
          the pen. He has taught man that which he knew not” [al-‘Alaq 96:1-5]
          <br />
          It has been Narrated by `Uthman that, The Prophet (ﷺ) said, “The best
          among you (Muslims) are those who learn the Qur’an and teach it.”
          (Bukhari)
          <br />
          So, this Hadith shows that best of all are those who are associated
          with Quran (by learning it and conveying its beneficial knowledge.
          <br />
          In additional to that, the superiority of the Qur’an above other kinds
          of any other speech it been narrated by Abu Musa Al-Ash`ari that the
          Prophet (ﷺ) said, “The example of him (a believer) who recites the
          Qur’an is like that of a citron which tastes good and smells good. And
          he (a believer) who does not recite the Qur’an is like a date which is
          good in taste but has no smell. And the example of a dissolute wicked
          person who recites the Qur’an is like the Raihana (sweet basil) which
          smells good but tastes bitter. And the example of a dissolute wicked
          person who does not recite the Qur’an is like the colocynth which
          tastes bitter and has no smell.
          <br />
          Importance of Quran learning can be understood through many examples.
          Reading Surah Al Mulk daily at night will save person from punishment
          in grave and is Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ): “He (ﷺ) used to recite
          Surah As-Sajdah and Surah Al-Mulk before sleeping.”
          <br />
          Also, Surah AL Fatiha is declared as Shifa/cure for every illness, it
          has been narrated by Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri: While we were on one of our
          journeys, we dismounted at a place where a slave girl came and said,
          “The chief of this tribe has been stung by a scorpion and our men are
          not present; is there anybody among you who can treat him (by reciting
          something)?” Then one of our men went along with her though we did not
          think that he knew any such treatment. But he treated the chief by
          reciting something, and the sick man recovered whereupon he gave him
          thirty sheep and gave us milk to drink (as a reward). When he
          returned, we asked our friend, “Did you know how to treat with the
          recitation of something?” He said, “No, but I treated him only with
          the recitation of the Mother of the Book (i.e., Al-Fatiha).” We said,
          “Do not say anything (about it) till we reach or ask the Prophet (ﷺ)
          so when we reached Medina, we mentioned that to the Prophet (in order
          to know whether the sheep which we had taken were lawful to take or
          not). The Prophet (ﷺ) said, “How did he come to know that it
          (Al-Fatiha) could be used for treatment? Distribute your reward and
          assign for me one share thereof as well.”
          <br />
          Another Virtue of the Qur’an is about Surah Al Kahf, it comes in a
          hadith: “Whoever memorized the first ten ayahs of Surah Kahf will be
          saved from Dajjal. (Sahih Muslim)”
          <br />
          Etiquettes and Rules of Learning Quran We learn from the Sunnah of
          Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) and from the traditions of his companions (Sahaba
          (R.A)) that Qur’an should be recited with esteem and concentration of
          heart and mind. Muslims when memorize or learn Qur’an, they need to
          keep revising it so that they do not forget it because it is
          considered as sin to forget Quran after acquiring its knowledge. Allah
          (s.w.t) has made it compulsory on us to learn knowledge of Quran and
          impart it to others. It is one of the etiquettes that a person is in
          state of Wudu (ablution) while reciting and the place is free of
          nijasat (impurities). It is the responsibility on a Muslim to correct
          the mistakes of other Muslim when he/she is doing mistakes while
          reading Qur’an. One should learn from a teacher who has proficient
          knowledge of Quran with Tajweed and Tafsir so that we get better in
          understanding Quran. While reading the Qur’an, understanding its
          content and pondering over it are not-to-be-missed ingredients of the
          whole process. We need to make dua that O Allah(s.w.t)! grant us with
          the best understanding of your holy book Qur’an and guide us to the
          straight path, Ameen.
